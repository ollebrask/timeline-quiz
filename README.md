## User Stories

- Track their score in real-time after each question is answered.
- See the correct year for each quiz-question displayed at the timeline at the bottom after answering.
- Have a visual indication of which was the right or wrong answer once they have made their choice.
- Have an option to reset the quiz and start again.
